# Introduction

Welcome to Wizard, your browser-based development environment for Arbitrum Stylus smart contracts.

## What is Wizard?

Wizard is an all-in-one development environment that makes Stylus smart contract development accessible and efficient. Unlike traditional setups that require extensive local configuration, Wizard provides a complete development environment right in your browser.

According to [Arbitrum's documentation](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/quickstart), getting started with Stylus development traditionally requires multiple setup steps. Here's how Wizard compares:

<div class="comparison-table">

| Feature | Traditional Setup | Wizard |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Initial Setup Time | 30+ minutes of installation & configuration | < 30 seconds - just open browser |
| Prerequisites | Rust toolchain, Docker, VS Code, Foundry | Modern web browser only |
| Development Environment | Local machine setup with multiple tools | Fully browser-based IDE |
| Compilation | Local WASM toolchain configuration | Instant cloud compilation |
| Deployment | Manual wallet & network configuration | One-click deployment with pre-funded wallet |
| Contract Testing | Local test environment setup | Instant ABI generation & call interface for methods |
| Updates & Maintenance | Manual toolchain updates | Always up-to-date platform |
| Team Collaboration | Complex environment sharing | Instant contract sharing |
